# SQL-Rockbuster
Rockbuster   Stealth   LLC   is   a   movie   rental   company   that   used   to   have   stores   around   the   world.  Facing  stiff   competition   from   streaming   services   such   as   Netflix   and   Amazon   Prime,   the   Rockbuster   Stealth   management   team   is   planning   to   use   its   existing   movie   licenses   to   launch   an   online   video   rental   service   in   order   to   stay   competitive.
